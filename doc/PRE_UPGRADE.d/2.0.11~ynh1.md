Welcome to this new release!
- Syncthing 2.0.11
- fixed an issue packaging side where the id's were changed on upgrade

Before updating, please check that you have disabled automatic updates in the Syncthing parameters as it should only be updated via YunoHost to prevent issues.https://github.com/3fla1416 proposed to disable upgrade directly in the package. Great idea! Every update of the package should now only be done through YunoHost app upgrade, and not internally anymore.
